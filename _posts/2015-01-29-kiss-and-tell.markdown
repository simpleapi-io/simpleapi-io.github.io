__Our Simple Manifesto__

1. Getting data should be simple
1. No one knows how you want your data better then you
1. No one knows what you want to do with your data better then you

As developers we have had to face the problem of accessing remote data for far too long. Soap is anything but clean and RESTful is anything but relaxing. Resources look one way when retrieved, but require a complete different representation when being pushed. We will no longer stand for it.

We are building a better solution. We are building a simple solution. We are building a SimpleAPI.

Join us as we expose APIs to the world.

We are striving to _Keep It Stupid Simple_ and telling the world about it along the way.
